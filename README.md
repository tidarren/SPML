### Final Project: Adversarial Patch

Adversarial patch is type of attack that any image with adversarial patch will be recognized as target class. For example, no matter what image contains (apple, phone, human, etc.), when it adds an adversarial patch of class toaster, all of them will be classified as toaster, and this attack can even be used in physical world.
